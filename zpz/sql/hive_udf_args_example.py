'''
This is an example UDAF for Hive, to be processed by `zpz.sql.hive.make_udf` and used in tests.

What this UDAF does:

Take a single column `info_json`, which is `clustered`
by the `make` element in the JSON (i.e. records of the same `make`
come consecutively to the same Hive worker node),
parse this JSON to get `make` and `price`.
For each `make`, calculate average price of the records that have `price`;
also count the records that lack `price`.
Print out three columns:

    `make`, `average_price`, `number_of_null_price`

Since this UDAF requires the records to be already clustered by `make`,
the caller necessarily needs to extract `make` from `info_json` and use it.
So, the caller may as well provide two columns: `make` and `info_json`.
That would simplify this UDAF a little bit.

Here we assume the caller does not provide that convenience.
