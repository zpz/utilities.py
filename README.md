## Python utilities

This packages collects some small Python utilities that I have created in practice.
There is no clear scope except that the utilities all tend to be small and self-contained.

There is no plan to maintain this code as a coherent library.
The recommended way to use it is to copy-paste whatever segments you find useful.
