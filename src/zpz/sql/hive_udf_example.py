'''
This is an example UDF for Hive, to be processed by `zpz.sql.hive.make_udf` and used in tests.

UDFs should follow this example. The main points include:

1. The code in this module is written against the Python version that is available on the Hive cluster.

2. This module should be *self sufficient* except for using Python standard libraries. It should not use disk files.

3. This example defines a main function that processes a single line, and the entry block
   passes individual lines on stdin to this function. This is a reasonable pattern to used.

   However, if you have an existing UDF script that works but does not follow this pattern,
   it is not necessary to modify the script. It is expected that `zpz.sql.hive.make_udf` 'just works'.

4. `from __future__ import print_function` is recommended. If this module is written against Python 2,
   but this module needs to be imported into Python 3 code, then this import is required.

What this UDF does:

Take two columns: `id`, `info_json`.
Parse `info_json` to get `make` and `price`.
Print out these two columns.
If `price` does not exist in `make`, that column is NULL.

SEP = '\t'
NULL = '\\N'


def main():
    for line in sys.stdin:
        _, info_json = line.strip().split(SEP)
        info = json.loads(info_json)
        print(info['make'] + SEP + str(info.get('price', NULL)))
